(4, 'Becoming pregnant', 'Ovulation occurs each month when an egg (ovum) is released from one of the ovaries. Occasionally, more than one egg is released, usually within 24 hours of the first egg. The ‘fingers’ at the end of the fallopian tubes help to direct the egg down into the tube. At the same time, the lining of the uterus begins to thicken and the mucus in the cervix becomes thinner so that sperm can swim through it more easily. The egg begins to travel down the fallopian tube. If a man and woman have recently had sex, the egg might be fertilised here by the man’s sperm. The lining of the uterus is now thick enough for the fertilised egg to be implanted. If the egg is not fertilised, it will pass out of the body during the woman’s monthly period along with the lining of the uterus, which is also shed. The egg is so small that it cannot be seen. \r\n\r\nConception is the process that begins with the fertilisation of an egg and ends with the implantation of an egg into a woman’s uterus.\r\n\r\nOvulation: A woman conceives around the time she is ovulating; that is, when an egg has been released from one of her ovaries into one of her fallopian tubes. \r\n\r\nFertilisation: During sex, sperm are ejaculated from a man’s penis into a woman’s vagina. In one ejaculation there may be more than 300 million sperm. Most of the sperm leak out of the vagina but some begin to swim up through the cervix. When a woman is ovulating, the mucus in the cervix is thinner than usual to let sperm pass through more easily. Sperm swim into the uterus and into the fallopian tubes. Fertilisation takes place if a sperm joins with an egg and fertilises it. \r\n\r\nImplantation:  During the week after fertilisation, the fertilised egg (which is now an embryo) moves slowly down the fallopian tube and into the uterus. It is already growing. The embryo attaches itself firmly to the specially thickened uterus lining. This is called implantation. Hormones released by the embryonic tissue prevent the uterus lining from being shed. This is why women miss their periods when they are pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlink sources: https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/sites/default/files/2023-06/Preg%20book%202023%20complete.pdf', '4-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 1, 1, '2024-07-30 10:13:41'),
(5, 'Women and Hormones', '1) Hormones \r\nBoth men and women have hormones, which are chemicals that circulate in the bloodstream. They carry messages to different parts of the body and result in certain changes taking place. Female hormones, which include oestrogen and progesterone, control many of the events of a woman’s monthly cycle, such as the release of eggs from her ovaries and the thickening of her uterus lining. During pregnancy, your hormone levels change. As soon as you have conceived, the amount of oestrogen and progesterone in your blood increases. This causes the uterus lining to build up, the blood supply to your uterus and breasts to increase and the muscles of your uterus to relax to make room for the growing baby. The increase in hormone levels can affect how you feel. You may have mood swings, feel tearful or be easily irritated. For a while you may feel that you cannot control your emotions, but these symptoms should ease after the first three months of your pregnancy. \r\n\r\n2) Boy or girl? \r\nEvery normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes, except for male sperm and female eggs. These contain 23 chromosomes each. When a sperm fertilises an egg, the 23 chromosomes from the father pair with the 23 from the mother, making 46 in all. Chromosomes are tiny, threadlike structures which each carry about 2,000 genes. Genes determine a baby’s inherited characteristics, such as hair and eye colour, blood group, height and build. A fertilised egg contains one sex chromosome from its mother and one from its father. The sex chromosome from the mother’s egg is always the same and is known as the X chromosome. The sex chromosome from the father’s sperm can be an X or a Y chromosome. If the egg is fertilised by a sperm containing an X chromosome, the baby will be a girl (XX). If the sperm contains a Y chromosome, the baby will be a boy (XY). \r\n\r\n3)Twins, triplets or more \r\nIdentical twins occur when one fertilised egg splits into two; each baby will have the same genes – and therefore they will be the same sex and look very alike. Non-identical twins are more common. They are the result of two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time. The babies may be of the same sex or different sexes, and will probably look no more alike than any other brothers and sisters. A third of all twins will be identical and two-thirds non-identical. Twins happen in about 1 in every 65 pregnancies. A Becoming pregnant 13 couple is more likely to have twins if there are twins in the woman’s family. Triplets occur naturally in 1 in 10,000 pregnancies and quads are even rarer. Nowadays, the use of treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has made multiple births more common. \r\n\r\n4) Are you carrying twins? \r\nYou might suspect that you are carrying more than one baby if: \r\n• you are very sick in early pregnancy; \r\n• you seem bigger than you should be for your ‘dates’; \r\n• you have had fertility treatment.\r\n\r\n It is usually possible to find out through your dating ultrasound scan, which happens between eight and 12 weeks. You may need another scan after this to find out whether the babies share a placenta (are identical) or if they have two separate placentas, in which case they can be either identical or non-identical. It is important to know this because women with babies who share a placenta will need to have more appointments and scans. If this cannot be determined, you should be offered a further scan. A third of identical twins have two separate placentas. This happens when the fertilised egg splits in the first 3–4 days after conception and before it implants in the uterus. \r\n\r\n5) What is different about being pregnant with twins or more? \r\nMultiple pregnancies have a higher risk of complications – particularly premature birth. If your babies share a placenta (identical twins) or if you are having more than two babies, you should be offered pregnancy care at a special clinic for multiple pregnancies. These clinics are not held in every hospital in Northern Ireland, and you might need to travel to another hospital. Your doctor might also refer you to the Regional Fetal Medicine Service in Belfast if you require more specialised care. If your babies are triplets or if they share a placenta it is recommended that you are scanned every two weeks from 16 weeks onwards, and every four weeks if your babies have separate placentas. You are more likely to have a caesarean section but twins can sometimes be delivered vaginally. Your doctor should discuss this with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlink sources: https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/sites/default/files/202306/Preg%20book%202023%20complete.pdf', '5-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 1, 1, '2024-06-11 12:11:39'),
(6, 'Now you are pregnant', 'The time from when you find out you are pregnant until you have your baby is the antenatal period and during this time you will receive your care from the most appropriate person for your pregnancy. As soon as you know you are pregnant, you should get in touch with your maternity service or GP to organise your antenatal care. It’s best to see them as early as possible. You can complete a self referral form to maternity services online via your local Health and Social Care Trust website, or contact your GP surgery and they will refer you to maternity services where you will see a midwife. \r\n\r\nWhen you first make contact with your midwife or GP you will be given information about: \r\n• folic acid and vitamin D supplements; \r\n• nutrition and diet; \r\n• food hygiene; \r\n• lifestyle factors that may affect your health or the health of your baby, such as smoking, recreational drug use and alcohol consumption. \r\n\r\nWhat is a midwife? \r\nThe midwife is the main provider of care for most pregnant women. Midwives are highly skilled, qualified professionals who care for women during normal pregnancy, childbirth and after the birth. You will be introduced to your midwife, who will care for you during pregnancy and when you go home. You may meet different members of a team of midwives throughout your pregnancy. Midwives are trained to make sure everything goes as well as possible and to recognise any potential problems for you and your baby. Midwives work both in maternity units and in the community, often in a team system. The style of care may depend on where you live. Community midwives may visit you at home before the birth and will continue to care for you after the birth.\r\n', '6-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 1, 1, '2024-06-11 12:20:31'),
(7, 'Feeding your baby', 'It’s never too early to start thinking about how you are going to feed your baby. Breastfeeding gives your baby the best possible start in life as it has lots of benefits for both you and your baby that last a lifetime. Discuss your plans with your partner and family as their help is important. You might like to watch the Bump to Breastfeeding video together to see what feeding your baby might be like.\r\n\r\n• Your breastmilk is the only food designed for your baby. It contains everything your baby needs for around the first six months of life. After that, giving your baby breastmilk along with solid food will help them continue to grow and develop. The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for two years or longer. \r\n• Breastfeeding protects your baby from various infections and diseases. It also offers health benefits for mums. Every day makes a difference to your baby, as the longer you breastfeed, the longer the protection lasts. Formula milk cannot provide your baby with the same ingredients or give the same protection. \r\n• Breastfeeding helps build a strong bond between mother and baby, both physically and emotionally. \r\n• Breastfeeding reduces the risk of sudden infant death. \r\n\r\nWhat does breastfeeding help protect against? \r\nYour baby: \r\n• Ear infections \r\n• Allergies \r\n•Sudden infant death \r\n• Childhood leukaemia \r\n• Chest infections \r\n• Obesity •\r\n Gastro-intestinal infections\r\n • Childhood diabetes \r\n• Urinary tract infections \r\nYou: •\r\n Breast cancer \r\n• Type 2 diabetes \r\n• Ovarian cancer \r\n• Women who breastfeed get their figures back faster\r\nBreastfeeding Just like any new skill, breastfeeding may take time and practice to work. In the first few days, you and your baby will be getting to know each other. Close contact and holding your baby against your skin can really help with this. The more time you spend with your baby, the quicker you will learn to understand each other’s signs and signals. The next few pages will help you to understand how breastfeeding works. And remember, it’s OK to ask for help. \r\n', '7-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 3, 1, '2024-06-11 12:30:55'),
(8, 'Types of milk to avoid', 'Cows’ milk should not be given as a main drink to a child under the age of one year. Small amounts of cows’ milk can be used for cooking after six months of age. Condensed milk, evaporated milk, dried milk, sheep’s milk, goats’ milk, or any other type of ‘milk’ drink (such as rice, oat, almond, soy, coconut, flax or hemp drinks) should never be given to a baby under the age of one year. You should not use soya formula unless it has been prescribed by your GP. If you are giving your baby infant formula, first infant formula (whey-based) is the only formula they will need in the first year. Follow-on formula is not suitable for babies under six months.\r\n\r\n1)	Formula feeding (bottlefeeding) \r\nThe following advice is based on guidance from the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency. It may differ from what you have done before if you have older children, but to minimise any risk it is recommended that you follow this advice.\r\n\r\n2)	 Helpful tips \r\nThere are a number of different brands of infant formula milk available in the shops. While baby milk companies may claim their formula is closest to breastmilk and better than others, all must meet regulated standards and there is actually very little difference between them all. The most expensive milk is not necessarily the best, supermarket own brands are much cheaper and meet the required regulations. In the past it was thought better to stick to one brand, but there is no evidence to suggest that changing brands does any good or any harm.\r\n', '8-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 3, 1, '2024-06-11 12:39:17'),
(9, 'Choosing a Formula', '1)	Choosing a formula \r\n\r\nInfant formula milk usually comes in powder form and is based on processed, skimmed cows’ milk, and is treated so babies can digest it. Vegetable oils, vitamins, minerals and fatty acids are added to make sure the milk contains the vitamins and minerals that young babies need. This information will be on the contents list on the pack. Infant formula powders are not sterile, so it is important to follow the cleaning and sterilising instructions on page 139. Formula is either ‘whey dominant’ or ‘casein dominant’, depending on the balance of proteins it contains. It may also be referred to as stage one or stage two milk. Whey-dominant milk is thought to be easier to digest than casein-dominant milk, so should always be the first formula you give your baby. There is little nutritional difference in the two forms of milk, so if whey-dominant formula milk suits your baby, they can stay on it for the first year or even longer. ‘Ready-to-feed’ infant formula milk in cartons is also available. This is generally more expensive than powdered milk. Once opened, the carton should be stored in the fridge with the cut corner turned down. Discard any unused milk after 24 hours.\r\n\r\n2)	Vitamin drops\r\n\r\n If your baby is formula fed, you should give them vitamin drops which include vitamin D from the age of six months or if they are drinking less than 500ml of formula a day. You can buy suitable drops at any pharmacy. You can continue giving your baby infant formula when they are older than six months. If you have any worries about the infant formula milk you are giving your baby, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP for advice. \r\n\r\n3)	Responsive bottlefeeding \r\n\r\nHold your baby close in a semi-upright position so that you can see their face, look into their eyes and talk to them during the feed. Encourage your baby to open their mouth by gently rubbing the teat against their top lip. Gently insert the teat into your baby’s mouth and keep the bottle in a slightly tipped position not too upright so that you can stop milk from flowing too fast. Learn to notice their early feeding cues, such as getting restless and hand sucking, which tell you your baby wants to be fed. Try not to wait until they are really crying and upset before you offer a feed. When feeding, notice when they have had enough and don’t try to force them to take more than they want. Don’t let too many other people feed your baby, keep feeding as a special time for you, your partner and a few family members as this will help your baby feel safe and secure and will build up a close and loving bond with your baby. \r\n\r\n4)	Using formula milk safely \r\n\r\nPowdered infant formula milk must be prepared as carefully as possible. It is not a sterile product, and even though tins and packets of milk powder are sealed, they can contain bacteria such as Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii) and, more rarely, salmonella. If the feed is not prepared safely, these bacteria can cause infections. Infections are very rare, but can be life-threatening. Very young babies are at most risk, and it is better to use sterile, liquid ready-to-feed products for premature or low birth weight babies. Formula must therefore be made up with water hot enough to kill the bacteria – at least 70ºC. In practice, this means boiling the kettle and leaving it to cool for no longer than 30 minutes. Mix the formula and water and cool quickly to feeding temperature in cold water. It’s also essential to make up a fresh bottle for each feed. Throw away unused formula within two hours. Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature and can even survive and multiply slowly in some fridges, so storing formula milk for any length of time increases the risk.\r\n', '9-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 3, 1, '2024-06-11 12:47:50'),

(11, 'Energy needs throughout pregnancy', 'The main recommendation is to eat a healthy, balanced diet as described in the Malaysian Dietary Guidelines 2020 (NCCFN, 2021). The guidelines suggest that the proportion of macronutrients from total energy intake should be 50-65% carbohydrates, 10-20% protein, and 25-35% fat. The Recommended Nutrient Intakes for Malaysia (NCCFN, 2017) and the usual intake of the population help guide the number of servings for daily meals to achieve at least 90% of the RNI for energy, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. The energy requirement throughout pregnancy depends on factors like maternal pre-pregnancy weight status, physical activity, and the physiological demands of each trimester. The energy intake must meet the demands of maternal metabolism, physical activity, fetal growth, and the growth of other tissues such as fat mass, breast tissue, uterus, and placenta. The goal is to achieve appropriate weight gain to minimize the risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Metabolism during Pregnancy\r\n\r\nExtra energy is needed during pregnancy to support the growth and maintenance of the fetus, placenta, and maternal tissues (Jasper et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2019). The increase in energy needs is due to the increased metabolism of active tissues, such as the maternal cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory systems, as well as tissue synthesis. The average increase in metabolic rate throughout pregnancy is 4.5% for the first trimester, 10.8% for the second trimester, and 24.0% in the third trimester (Butte & King, 2005). This increased energy requirement also helps store energy for postpartum and breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nOptimal maternal and fetal outcomes depend on sufficient nutrient intake to meet both maternal and fetal needs. Energy is the primary nutrient that determines gestational weight gain and supports the pregnancy process. The extra energy required supports the growth and maintenance of the fetus, placenta, and maternal tissues, as well as the increased metabolism of active tissues. The energy consumption during pregnancy is linked to increased metabolism and physical activity, estimated at 77,000 kcal (FAO/WHO/UNU, 2004). The pregnancy process increases metabolic levels by about 10.7 ± 5.4 kcal per week, while the energy used increases by 5.2 ± 12.8 kcal per week (Most et al., 2019). The total increase in metabolism can be estimated according to the pregnant woman\'s resting energy expenditure (REE) (FAO/WHO/UNU, 2004). Studies of well-nourished women who gained adequate body mass during pregnancy estimate a cumulative increase of 147.8 MJ (35,330 kcal) for a 12 kg weight gain (EFSA Panel, 2013). The increased energy requirement during pregnancy is necessary to store energy for postpartum and breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nreferences: National Coordinating Committee on Food and Nutrition (NCCFN) Ministry of Health Malaysia 2023 \r\n', '11-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 2, 1, '2024-07-30 10:12:07'),
(12, 'Benefits of meeting the energy and  macronutrients needs ', 'Meeting energy needs during pregnancy can lead to desirable gestational weight gain (GWG) and optimal pregnancy outcomes (Most et al., 2019). However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies found no significant relationship between the increase in energy intake from early to late pregnancy and GWG (Jebeile et al., 2016). Underreporting of food intake might explain these findings, highlighting the need for high-quality longitudinal studies.\r\n\r\nEven though there is no direct link between energy intake and GWG, consuming nutrient-dense food to meet energy requirements is essential. This helps women meet the necessary micronutrient intake. Without increasing energy intake, women may not get enough essential nutrients, which can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. Extra energy is also necessary to support fetal growth, the growth of maternal tissues, and changes in maternal energy metabolism.\r\n\r\nA recent study in Japan involving 89,817 mother-child pairs examined how energy intake during pregnancy and GWG influenced birth weight (Minami et al., 2022). The study found a positive association between energy intake during pregnancy and birth weight, mediated by GWG. Excessive energy intake, whether too low or too high, increased the risk of abnormal birth size, emphasizing the importance of meeting optimal energy needs for appropriate GWG and fetal growth.\r\n\r\nMeeting energy and macronutrient needs during breastfeeding is also crucial for the health and well-being of both mothers and infants. Proper nutrition supports breast milk production, promotes optimal growth and development for the infant, and helps maintain the mother\'s nutritional status. A recent meta-regression analysis found a positive association between maternal BMI and human milk fat in term-born infants aged 1 to 6 months (Daniel et al., 2021). Specifically, for every 1 kg/m² increase in maternal BMI, there was a corresponding 0.56 g/L increase in milk-fat concentration. However, no association was observed between maternal BMI and human milk energy or total protein levels (Daniel et al., 2021). Additionally, a study among 367 pregnant women in Minneapolis and Oklahoma found that higher maternal diet quality at one and three months postpartum was associated with lower infant adiposity (Tahir et al., 2019). These findings underscore the importance of maternal nutrition and diet quality during breastfeeding in influencing both the composition of breast milk and the long-term health outcomes of infants.\r\n\r\nreferences: National Coordinating Committee on Food and Nutrition (NCCFN) Ministry of Health Malaysia 2023', '12-ContentLinkHeader.webp', 2, 1, '2024-07-30 10:16:48'),
(13, 'Special Considerations ', 'a. Maternal Obesity and Underweight\r\nThe ideal condition is to have an optimal BMI and good nutritional status before pregnancy. However, an increasing number of women are entering pregnancy with a weight exceeding the healthy range. This is critical as obesity during pregnancy significantly contributes to maternal and perinatal morbidity, with a rising global prevalence among reproductive-aged women (Giouleka et al., 2023). Women with obesity are more likely to experience complications such as excessive GWG (over 60% prevalence), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders, non-elective cesarean sections, and having macrosomic infants (Kim & Ayabe, 2023). However, weight loss through restrictive diets is not recommended during pregnancy as it can lead to inadequate nutrient intake, negatively impacting fetal growth and development.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for energy intake were mainly based on studies involving pregnant women without obesity (IOM, 2009). Women with overweight and obesity are twice as likely to exceed these guidelines, leading to only one-third of pregnant women achieving the recommended weight gain for healthy maternal, neonatal, and infant outcomes. Therefore, recommending appropriate energy and macronutrient needs is crucial for women with obesity during pregnancy. Most et al. (2019b) recommended that the daily energy intake during the second and third trimesters should not exceed energy expenditure to achieve the recommended rate of weight gain. This means that pregnant women with obesity should not consume additional energy intake, as the extra energy for fetal development can be compensated by maternal fat mass without adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes (Most et al., 2019a). Therefore, the energy needs for women with obesity must be personalized and include physical activity and improved dietary quality. Excessive energy intake rather than decreased energy expenditure after pregnancy can lead to postpartum weight gain (Most et al., 2020). Thus, women should be advised not to overeat after pregnancy, and appropriate dietary recommendations should be given to women with obesity during the postpartum period.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, women with an underweight pre-pregnancy BMI have a significantly higher risk of delivering a low birth weight (LBW) infant. A cross-sectional survey in Taiwan found that processed food consumption in the third trimester was associated with LBW. Nutritious food during pregnancy is critical in preventing LBW, especially among older and pre-pregnant underweight women. Thus, prenatal nutrition advice should emphasize individualized optimal nutrition (Chen, Loy & Chen, 2023). LBW babies are more likely to not survive during the first month of life and tend to suffer from long-term consequences such as a higher risk of stunting, low IQ, and a higher risk of adult-onset non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like obesity and type 2 diabetes (UNICEF, 2023).\r\n\r\nb. Multiple Pregnancy\r\nThe maternal metabolic rate in twin pregnancies is approximately 10% greater than in singleton pregnancies. Multiple gestations demand more physiologically than singleton pregnancies, including increased plasma volume and decreased levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and water-soluble vitamins. Generally, the energy demand is higher for multiple pregnancies. However, more position statements from scientific societies are needed to specify the required energy intake. Due to a lack of studies on the actual energy needs of women pregnant with twins, Wierzejska (2022) theoretically assumed that an additional 150 kcal/day might be needed compared to singleton pregnancies, aiming for a target GWG of 20 kg. It is also estimated that a 40% higher-calorie diet may maintain a woman\'s nutritional state during a twin pregnancy. There is a lack of evidence for the nutritional management of other multiple pregnancies (triplets, quadruplets), but they can be managed similarly to twin gestations (Kominiarek & Rajan, 2016).\r\n\r\nc. Adolescent Pregnancy\r\nPregnancy physiology differs in teenagers compared to adult women. Pregnant teenagers, especially those under 16, face a significant risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality due to the continuing and incomplete growth of the teenagers themselves (Wallace, 2019). Nutritional needs change during pregnancy, with increased requirements for energy and several micronutrients. Optimal dietary intake is critically important during continued growth and development. However, the dietary patterns of pregnant teens are generally less healthy than those of adult pregnant women. Teen diets often include higher intakes of snacks and processed foods, fewer fruits and vegetables, and fewer nutritional supplements (Marvin-Dowle et al., 2018; Samano et al., 2022).\r\n\r\nSystematic reviews report that energy and micronutrient intakes in adolescent pregnancies are below recommended levels. Blood markers indicate that anemia and low iron status may be prevalent in this population (Marvin-Dowle, Burley & Soltani, 2016). Teen pregnancy is also a risk factor for both excessive (37%) and insufficient (41%) GWG (Samano et al., 2022). The diet of Mexican pregnant teens associated with excessive GWG includes cereals, grains, and animal-sourced foods but inadequate legumes. However, energy and macronutrient intake and eating habits were not directly associated with GWG (Samano et al., 2022). Therefore, the recommended energy intake for pregnant teens must align with their age-specific needs, considering the pregnancy trimesters.\r\n\r\nd. Vegetarians\r\nThe American Dietetic Association states that vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and safe for all age groups and physiological conditions, including childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, and breastfeeding (Vesanto, Craig & Levin, 2016). The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine also supports a plant-based diet as a healthy choice at every life stage, including pregnancy and breastfeeding (Hanson et al., 2015).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is crucial to include all food groups in the daily diet, considering their nutritional values. Both insufficient and excessive intake should be avoided as they can significantly impact health. Balanced vegetarian diets meet the nutritional needs of all life cycle stages, including pregnancy and breastfeeding. Well-planned vegetarians tend to consume less overall energy, lower dietary fat (particularly saturated fat) and dietary cholesterol, and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals than non-vegetarians. Due to the variability in vegetarian diets, individuals need to be familiar with their nutritional needs and potential dietary deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of macronutrients required during breastfeeding do not differ from those of non-lactating women. Lactating women can acquire all essential amino acids from high-quality protein sources such as meat, fish, eggs, and milk. For vegetarian women, plant protein sources, including legumes, nuts, fruits, starchy root vegetables, and cereals, should be combined to ensure all essential amino acids are consumed. Minimally processed carbohydrates and fiber should be consumed in similar proportions as in the pregnancy diet (Hanson et al., 2015). Pregnant and breastfeeding women on a vegan diet should pay special attention to their dietary intake and seek advice from healthcare professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreference: National Coordinating Committee on Food and Nutrition (NCCFN) Ministry of Health Malaysia 2023\r\n\r\n\r\n', '13-ContentLinkHeader.jpg', 2, 1, '2024-07-30 10:26:56');

These resources are often used to uncover information such as names, job titles and email addresses of potential victims. An attacker can then use information to craft a believable phishing email.<br><br>\r\nTypically, a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or organization. The attack is then carried out either when the victim clicks on a malicious file attachment or clicks on a hyperlink connecting them to a malicious website. In either case, the attacker&#39;s objective is to install malware on the user&#39;s device or direct them to a fake website.

Muhammad Ali explained that once the victim clicks on the APK file, the scammer would have automatic control of the victim’s phone.The APK files allow the scammers to steal data from users’ mobile phones, including users TAC number which allow them to make unauthorised banking transactions.<br><br>\r\n<b>Ways malware can get into your device</b><br><br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Phishing and malspam emails:\r\n    <p>Usually, the main objective of phishing emails is to wheedle sensitive information out of you, such as your access credentials to various services, your card verification code (last three digits on the backside of your payment card), PIN code, or other personally identifiable information (PII). But by masquerading as mail from a trusted institution, they may contain attachments or links that will lead to your device getting infested with malware. Therefore, it’s always prudent to not just skim over your emails but read them thoroughly. More often than not, you’ll notice dead giveaways that you’re dealing with a scam. Telltale signs usually include spelling mistakes, evoking a sense of urgency, requesting personal information, or the email originating from a suspicious domain.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fraudulent websites:\r\n    <p>To trick victims into downloading malicious apps, cybercriminals like to spoof websites of famous brands or organizations. The scammers create fraudulent webpages impersonating the real deal, with the domain name resembling the domain of the organization being spoofed as closely as possible, with some subtle differences here and there, such as adding a letter or symbol or even a whole word. The websites will be malware-laced and will try to dupe the target into clicking on links that will download malware into their devices. To avoid getting your device infested with malware by visiting one of these websites, always search for the official domain by typing it into a search engine or by typing it manually into the address bar. It bears repeating that a proper security solution will also protect you from most threats and will also block you from accessing known malicious websites.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    USB flash drives:\r\n    <p>External storage devices are a popular form of storing and transferring files; however, they do carry a number of risks. For example, threat actors like to use the “lost” flash-drive social engineering strategy to dupe unwitting good Samaritans into plugging a compromised thumb drive into their computers. Once an afflicted drive is plugged in and opened, your device can get infested with a keylogger or ransomware. Alternatively, if you aren’t careful about how you handle your flash drive, your computer may get infested by cross-contamination. To mitigate the chances of contaminating your PC, you should use a reputable and up-to-date endpoint security solution that will scan any external media plugged into your device and warn you if it contains anything suspicious.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    P2P sharing and torrents:\r\n    <p>While over the years, peer-to-peer sharing and torrents have gained a reputation for being a place to illegally download software, games, and media, they have been used by developers as an easy way to disseminate their open-source software or musicians to spread their songs. However, they are also infamous for being abused by black hats who inject the shared files with malicious code. Most recently, ESET researchers uncovered cybercriminals misusing the BitTorrent protocol and Tor network to spread KryptoCibule, a multitasking multicurrency cryptostealer. To minimize the risk of being compromised, you should use a reputable Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your traffic and keep it safe from prying eyes. You should also use an up-to-date security solution that can protect you from most threats, including viruses or malware that may be a part of the files you’re trying to torrent.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Compromised software:\r\n    <p>Although it may not happen often, software being directly compromised by threat actors isn’t a rare occurrence. One prominent example of an application’s security being compromised was the case of CCleaner. In these attacks, the black hats inject the malware directly into the application, which is then used to spread the malware when unsuspecting users download the app. Since CCleaner is a trusted application, it wouldn’t have occurred to a user to overly scrutinize it. However, you should be careful when downloading any type of software – even the one you trust. You also can’t go wrong by using a reputable security solution, and don’t forget to patch and update your apps regularly; security patches usually deal with any vulnerabilities or loopholes found in the affected apps.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Adware:\r\n    <p>Some websites are riddled with various ads that pop up whenever you click on any section of the webpage or can even appear immediately whenever you access certain websites. While the aim of these ads is generally to generate revenue for these sites, sometimes they are laced with various types of malware, and by clicking on these ads or adware, you may involuntarily download it onto your device. Some ads even use scare tactics telling users that their devices have been compromised and only the solution offered in the ad can clean up the compromise; however, that is almost never the case. A sizeable amount of the adware can be avoided by using trusted ad-blocking extensions on your browser, which will, as the name suggests, block ads from appearing on the website you’re visiting. Another thing you can do is avoid suspicious websites that use such advertisements altogether.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fake apps:\r\n    <p>The last item on this list deals with fake mobile applications. These apps usually masquerade as the real thing and try to dupe users into downloading them into the victims’ devices, thereby compromising the devices. They can take on the guise of anything, posing as fitness-tracking tools, cryptocurrency apps, or even COVID-19 tracing apps. However, in reality, instead of receiving the advertised services, the devices will get infested with various flavors of malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or keyloggers.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo avoid downloading any malicious apps onto your devices, you should stick with applications offered by trusted developers with a verifiable track record and reviews. Also keeping your devices patched and up-to-date can help you stay protected from various threats that would try to exploit the vulnerabilities that may be present in older versions of apps and operating systems.<br><br>\r\n\r\nExample of fake apps: Woman loses RM20,000 after downloading a fake application\r\n<br><br><center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield/uploads/content/image5.jpg?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center><br><br>\r\nA 47-year-old woman recently fell victim to an online advertising scam after downloading an application on her smartphone.

She engaged in a conversation with a sales representative, providing personal information and receiving a link to download their specialized application.<br><br>\r\nThrough the app, Yap was asked to make a payment before the housekeeping service could be confirmed for her. While in the application, she was taken to a banking page and attempted to make a money transfer but claimed it was unsuccessful.<br><br>\r\nLater, Yap checked her bank account using her laptop and discovered that RM7,500 had suddenly disappeared.

(10, 'How do you remove malware?', 'image101.png', 2, 'You can do several things to detect the presence of malware on your PC or Android device, the primary of which is to run a standard antivirus scan. There are many different antivirus scans and programs that you can add to your phone. These programs can be either free or paid. Keep in mind that the most expensive antivirus program isn’t always the best. So, ensure that you select a program that offers complete functionality and doesn’t solely provide a quick scan feature.<br><br>\r\n\r\nQuick scans can help check common areas of your device for viruses. Full scans, however, are necessary if you want the program to check every facet of your Android phone. A quick scan may also give you a false belief that your phone is free from viruses and harmful malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Windows Users</b><br><br>\r\nStep 1: Download and install antivirus software<br><br>\r\nThere are two main types of antivirus software that can detect and remove computer viruses and malware: real-time and on-demand. A real-time malware scanner scans for viruses in the background while you’re using your computer. An on-demand scanner, like Microsoft Defender, has to be turned on every time you want to check for malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor full virus and malware protection especially against new and emerging threats. Install real-time malware scanning and removal software.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 2: Run a virus scan<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter installing your antivirus software, you need to check your computer for any malware by running a full virus scan. A comprehensive scanner will search your computer for any malicious code hiding in Windows, and it will get rid of it. Open your antivirus app and select Run Smart Scan.<br><br>\r\nStep 3: Delete or quarantine infected files<br><br>\r\nAfter scanning your PC, your antivirus software will let you know if any malware is found. Follow the steps to remove the virus or put any infected files into quarantine.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 4: Restart your computer<br><br>\r\nAfter deleting the infected files from quarantine, restart your computer. Your laptop’s malware infection will be gone.<br><br>\r\n<b>Android Users</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce you have detected malware on your Android phone, you can remove the malware by following five simple steps.<br><br>\r\nStep 1: Immediately Turn Your Phone Off Before Performing Some Research<br><br>\r\nUpon detecting malware, you should turn the device off entirely while you perform some research. Turning the device off should keep the problem from worsening and may stop the malware from spreading to other networks in the vicinity.\r\nIf you know the name of the application or program that contains malware, you should take this time to research the program’s name to learn more about what it could be doing to your phone. If you don’t know the name, consider looking up the symptoms you’ve noticed on another computer. The only way to eliminate malware on an Android phone is to identify the app that’s infected with malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 2: Turn the Phone On in Safe Mode or Emergency Mode<br><br>\r\nOnce you know which application needs to be uninstalled and deleted, you should turn your phone on in safe mode or emergency mode. Switching to safe mode is relatively simple for most Android devices and can occur by turning your device on, holding the power button down for several seconds, and tapping the power-off button. From here, you should be given “power” options like reboot and safe mode. Once you activate the safe-mode option, your phone will restart. Being in safe mode is necessary to keep the malware from spreading as you uninstall the program with malware in it.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 3: Go to Device Settings to Locate the Malicious App<br><br>\r\nWhen you’re in safe mode, enter the “settings” section on your Android phone. You can access this mode by clicking the gear-shaped icon on the screen. You can also search for the “settings” section on your device. In settings, scroll down until you see the “apps” option, which you should click on. You’ll then be given a list of the applications that are present on your phone. Look through this list until you notice the app that’s infected and needs to be uninstalled. If the application is a core app, you may be unable to delete it. Instead, you would have the option of disabling the app. However, it’s unlikely that a core app is the source of a virus or malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 4: Uninstall the Infected Application<br><br>\r\nUninstalling an application is easy and begins with selecting the app, which will provide you with options like “force stop”, “force close”, or “uninstall”. Select the uninstall option to get rid of the application that has been causing problems on your phone. There are times when you will be unable to delete the application that contains the virus properly. This scenario can happen if your phone has been hijacked with ransomware. In this situation, the ransomware can get into your administrative settings, ensuring that the app can’t be deleted. You can fix this problem by going to the main settings menu and selecting the “security” section. From here, search for the “phone device administrators” area. In this area, you should have the ability to change your administrator settings and allow you to delete the app.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 5: Opt For A Factory Reset<br><br>\r\nIf you’re willing to say goodbye to the current media and content on your Android phone, a factory reset is an excellent option to eliminate the malware. This process does remove viruses and malware, but more potent malware may survive. You may detect as much malware as possible with a deep antivirus scan.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 6: Download Malware Protection<br><br>\r\nWhen you successfully eliminate the malware, you should focus on downloading malware protection and increasing your knowledge on how to remove malware from Android devices. Ensure that you use a program that will delete unnecessary files, protect your information, and scan for viruses. You should also check for updates regularly to keep the antivirus program up-to-date with the protection it offers.\r\n\r\n', 6),

(13, 'What is pretexting?', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIIvsJ3yi8o', 1, 'Pretexting is a certain type of social engineering technique that manipulates victims into divulging information. A pretext is a made-up scenario developed by threat actors for the purpose of stealing a victim’s personal data.<br><br>\r\nDuring pretexting attacks, threat actors typically ask victims for certain information, stating that it is needed to confirm the victim’s identity. In reality, the threat actor steals this information and then uses it to carry out secondary attacks or identity theft.<br><br>\r\nSophisticated pretexting attacks may attempt to trick victims into performing an action that exploits the physical and/or digital weaknesses of an organization. For example, a threat actor might pretend to be an external IT services auditor and use this alias to convince the physical security team of an organization to allow the threat actor to enter the building.<br><br>\r\nMany threat actors who adopt this attack type masquerade as employees or HR personnel in the finance department. These disguises let them target C-level executives or other employees with extensive privileges, who are more valuable for attackers.<br><br>\r\nWhile phishing attacks tend to use urgency and fear to exploit victims, pretexting attacks establish a false sense of trust with a targeted victim. This requires threat actors to establish a credible story that does not make victims suspicious of any foul play.<br><br>\r\nIn Malaysia, prevalent case of pretexting involves scammers impersonating authorities such as the police, pegawai Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri (LDHN), Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) atau Kastam Diraja Malaysia (KDRM). These scammers contact victims via phone calls or messages and request their personal information.<br><br>\r\nExample of scammer impersonate as LHDN<br><br>\r\n<center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield/uploads/content/image4.png?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center>\r\n', 7),
(14, 'How does pretexting attacks work?', 'image49.png', 2, '<center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield/uploads/content/image51.png?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center><br><br>\r\nAs for how pretexting attacks work, you might think of it as writing a story. The cybercriminal casts themselves as a character and they come up with a plot, or ploy, that convinces victims to trust their character. The pretexting attack is considered successful when the victim falls for the story and takes action because of it. <br><br>\r\nFor instance, a scammer could pose as a person working at a credit card company and call victims asking to confirm their account details. If the victim believes them, they might just hand over their payment information, unbeknownst that it’s indeed heading in the hands of cybercriminals. The following are a few avenues that cybercriminals leverage to create their narrative. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Phishing</b><br><br>\r\nPhishing could be considered pretexting by email. To a degree, the terms go hand in hand because both involve a scenario to convince victims of handing over valuable information. That is by communicating under a false pretext, potentially posing as a trusted source. <br><br>\r\nSo, what is the difference between phishing and pretexting? In addition to the fact that phishing is conducted only by email, it’s also that pretexting relies entirely on emotional manipulation to gain information, while phishing might leverage more technical means like malware to gain information.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Tailgating</b><br><br>\r\nTailgating is like physical phishing. Fraudsters pose in real-life as someone else to gain access to restricted or confidential areas where they can get their hands on valuable information. For example, a tailgating pretexting attack might be carried out by someone impersonating a friendly food deliverer waiting to be let into a building, when in fact it’s a cybercriminal looking to creep on the devices inside.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Smishing</b><br><br>\r\nSmishing is phishing by SMS messaging, or text messaging. This can be a trusty avenue for pretexting attackers to connect with victims since texting is a more intimate form of communication — and victims might think only trusted persons would have their phone number.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Vishing</b><br><br>\r\nA combination of the words voice and phishing, vishing is just that: voice phishing, meaning phishing over the phone calls. In the context of a pretexting attack, fraudsters might spoof, or fake, caller IDs or use deepfake to convince victims they are a trusted source and, ultimately, get victims to share valuable information over the phone.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Impersonation</b><br><br>\r\nImpersonation is a technique at the crux of all pretexting attacks because fraudsters take on different identities to pull off their attacks, posing as everything from CEOs to law enforcement or insurance agents. What makes the impersonation strongest is when the pretexting attacker has done their homework on victims so little suspicion is raised about their legitimacy.\r\n\r\n', 8),

This added effort makes these attacks more difficult to detect. However, there are certain red flags that can help you identify these scams before you become the victim of a larger attack.<br><br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Urgent Language:<br> While a pretexter will go to great lengths to convincingly impersonate a trusted source, they are likely to work to complete the attack as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, the request is likely to include a time frame or language like ASAP, \"immediately\", or \"right away\". The message may also include reasons why a delay is catastrophic.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Unusual Requests:<br> You may receive a text, email, or phone message that follows normal communication routes and conversation styles. Yet, the red flag goes up when the request is out of the ordinary. Any request that requires sensitive information, the transfer of funds, or unusual downloads should be considered suspicious.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>False Familiarity:<br> A pretexting attack may open with casual communications like \"Are you free right now?\", \"I need your help\", or \"Can you do me a favor?\". The correspondence is likely to include your name or the names of people you know to create familiarity. Only after establishing trust, the attacker will reveal the request for money or sensitive information.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Excuses to Avoid Ongoing Communication:<br> A pretexting attack from a supervisor, executive, or CEO might include a reason why you were chosen to carry out a sensitive task as well as the reason they can&#39;t perform it themselves. For example, communications from the CEO might say they&#39;re stuck in meetings all day, making the victim reluctant to make contact for verification.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Spoofed Domain:<br> If an attacker doesn&#39;t have access to a legitimate website, they&#39;ll be forced to send communications from an unknown email. To remain discreet, they&#39;re likely to use a similar email or URL domain. In these instances, the sender&#39;s email or a linked URL may include easy-to-miss spelling errors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 8),

Baiters may tempt users with offers of free vouchers such as foodpanda in exchange for their login credentials on a specific website or free money in exchange they need to do provided tasks. <br><br>\r\nOne of the notorious baiting scams in Malaysia involves offering individuals \"part-time\" jobs with the promise of rewarding commissions upon completing tasks.

By leveraging enticing offers and taking advantage of human curiosity, fear, and greed, cybercriminals use baiting techniques to manipulate their targets into revealing sensitive data or performing actions that compromise their security. The ultimate objective of baiting attacks is to deceive individuals into providing personal information or financial resources that can be exploited by the attackers.<br><br>\r\nEvery human being has some level of curiosity, fear, and greed influencing his decisions and behavior and that is what criminals who set up baiting attacks exploit. Cybercriminals can achieve this through different techniques.<br><br>\r\nBelow are the common baiting attack methods to be aware of. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Tempting Offers</b><br><br>\r\nCybercriminals find major success using tempting offers to lure victims. They send targets enticing offers via ads, social media, email, or free downloadable content. They offer their victims access to free music, movies, games, and software. These offers are usually difficult to resist. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Malware-Infected Devices</b><br><br>\r\nAnother way cybercriminals execute a baiting attack is through malware-infected USB devices or flash drives. They leave the device in the open such as the company lobby, reception office, in front of the house or even in the mailbox. Once an employee or individual inserts the flash into their system, it automatically installs malware on the computer and infects the organization’s network.\r\n', 11),

Here are some tips to spot it:<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Research and verify: Before engaging with any opportunity or offer, thoroughly research the company, organization, or individual involved. Look for official websites, reviews, and independent sources to verify their legitimacy. Be skeptical of unsolicited emails, messages, or phone calls. Learn to think skeptically about any offer that’s too good to be true.</li>\r\n  <li>Be cautious of unrealistic promises: Scammers often entice victims with promises of high pay, easy work, or extravagant rewards. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Exercise caution and use your judgment to identify potential red flags.</li>\r\n  <li>Protect your personal information: Never share sensitive personal information, such as your Social Security number, bank account details, or credit card information, unless you have verified the legitimacy of the recipient and have a legitimate reason to provide it.</li>\r\n  <li>Use secure and reputable platforms: When searching for part-time jobs or engaging in online transactions, use reputable websites or platforms that have established credibility. Look for secure browsing indicators like HTTPS in the website URL.</li>\r\n  <li>Beware of upfront payments or fees: Scammers may ask you to pay upfront fees or provide financial information before starting a job or claiming a reward. Legitimate employers or companies generally do not require payment from employees or winners.</li>\r\n  <li>Trust your instincts: If something feels off or suspicious, trust your gut instinct. If you&#39;re unsure about a job offer, request more information or consult with friends, family, or professionals who can offer objective advice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 11),

Do you know where it’s coming from? If you don’t know where the link will direct you to, don’t click on it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe best practice is to hover on the link with your mouse to see where it might send you.

Muhammad Ali explained that once the victim clicks on the APK file, the scammer would have automatic control of the victim’s phone.The APK files allow the scammers to steal data from users’ mobile phones, including users TAC number which allow them to make unauthorised banking transactions.<br><br>\r\n<b>Ways malware can get into your device</b><br><br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Phishing and malspam emails:\r\n    <p>Usually, the main objective of phishing emails is to wheedle sensitive information out of you, such as your access credentials to various services, your card verification code (last three digits on the backside of your payment card), PIN code, or other personally identifiable information (PII). But by masquerading as mail from a trusted institution, they may contain attachments or links that will lead to your device getting infested with malware. Therefore, it’s always prudent to not just skim over your emails but read them thoroughly. More often than not, you’ll notice dead giveaways that you’re dealing with a scam. Telltale signs usually include spelling mistakes, evoking a sense of urgency, requesting personal information, or the email originating from a suspicious domain.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fraudulent websites:\r\n    <p>To trick victims into downloading malicious apps, cybercriminals like to spoof websites of famous brands or organizations. The scammers create fraudulent webpages impersonating the real deal, with the domain name resembling the domain of the organization being spoofed as closely as possible, with some subtle differences here and there, such as adding a letter or symbol or even a whole word. The websites will be malware-laced and will try to dupe the target into clicking on links that will download malware into their devices. To avoid getting your device infested with malware by visiting one of these websites, always search for the official domain by typing it into a search engine or by typing it manually into the address bar. It bears repeating that a proper security solution will also protect you from most threats and will also block you from accessing known malicious websites.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    USB flash drives:\r\n    <p>External storage devices are a popular form of storing and transferring files; however, they do carry a number of risks. For example, threat actors like to use the “lost” flash-drive social engineering strategy to dupe unwitting good Samaritans into plugging a compromised thumb drive into their computers. Once an afflicted drive is plugged in and opened, your device can get infested with a keylogger or ransomware. Alternatively, if you aren’t careful about how you handle your flash drive, your computer may get infested by cross-contamination. To mitigate the chances of contaminating your PC, you should use a reputable and up-to-date endpoint security solution that will scan any external media plugged into your device and warn you if it contains anything suspicious.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    P2P sharing and torrents:\r\n    <p>While over the years, peer-to-peer sharing and torrents have gained a reputation for being a place to illegally download software, games, and media, they have been used by developers as an easy way to disseminate their open-source software or musicians to spread their songs. However, they are also infamous for being abused by black hats who inject the shared files with malicious code. Most recently, ESET researchers uncovered cybercriminals misusing the BitTorrent protocol and Tor network to spread KryptoCibule, a multitasking multicurrency cryptostealer. To minimize the risk of being compromised, you should use a reputable Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your traffic and keep it safe from prying eyes. You should also use an up-to-date security solution that can protect you from most threats, including viruses or malware that may be a part of the files you’re trying to torrent.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Compromised software:\r\n    <p>Although it may not happen often, software being directly compromised by threat actors isn’t a rare occurrence. One prominent example of an application’s security being compromised was the case of CCleaner. In these attacks, the black hats inject the malware directly into the application, which is then used to spread the malware when unsuspecting users download the app. Since CCleaner is a trusted application, it wouldn’t have occurred to a user to overly scrutinize it. However, you should be careful when downloading any type of software – even the one you trust. You also can’t go wrong by using a reputable security solution, and don’t forget to patch and update your apps regularly; security patches usually deal with any vulnerabilities or loopholes found in the affected apps.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Adware:\r\n    <p>Some websites are riddled with various ads that pop up whenever you click on any section of the webpage or can even appear immediately whenever you access certain websites. While the aim of these ads is generally to generate revenue for these sites, sometimes they are laced with various types of malware, and by clicking on these ads or adware, you may involuntarily download it onto your device. Some ads even use scare tactics telling users that their devices have been compromised and only the solution offered in the ad can clean up the compromise; however, that is almost never the case. A sizeable amount of the adware can be avoided by using trusted ad-blocking extensions on your browser, which will, as the name suggests, block ads from appearing on the website you’re visiting. Another thing you can do is avoid suspicious websites that use such advertisements altogether.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fake apps:\r\n    <p>The last item on this list deals with fake mobile applications. These apps usually masquerade as the real thing and try to dupe users into downloading them into the victims’ devices, thereby compromising the devices. They can take on the guise of anything, posing as fitness-tracking tools, cryptocurrency apps, or even COVID-19 tracing apps. However, in reality, instead of receiving the advertised services, the devices will get infested with various flavors of malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or keyloggers.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo avoid downloading any malicious apps onto your devices, you should stick with applications offered by trusted developers with a verifiable track record and reviews. Also keeping your devices patched and up-to-date can help you stay protected from various threats that would try to exploit the vulnerabilities that may be present in older versions of apps and operating systems.<br><br>\r\n\r\nExample of fake apps: Woman loses RM20,000 after downloading a fake application\r\n<br><br><center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield1/uploads/content/image5.jpg?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center><br><br>\r\nA 47-year-old woman recently fell victim to an online advertising scam after downloading an application on her smartphone.

She engaged in a conversation with a sales representative, providing personal information and receiving a link to download their specialized application.<br><br>\r\nThrough the app, Yap was asked to make a payment before the housekeeping service could be confirmed for her.

(10, 'How do you remove malware?', 'image101.png', 2, 'You can do several things to detect the presence of malware on your PC or Android device, the primary of which is to run a standard antivirus scan. There are many different antivirus scans and programs that you can add to your phone. These programs can be either free or paid. Keep in mind that the most expensive antivirus program isn’t always the best. So, ensure that you select a program that offers complete functionality and doesn’t solely provide a quick scan feature.<br><br>\r\n\r\nQuick scans can help check common areas of your device for viruses. Full scans, however, are necessary if you want the program to check every facet of your Android phone. A quick scan may also give you a false belief that your phone is free from viruses and harmful malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Windows Users</b><br><br>\r\nStep 1: Download and install antivirus software<br><br>\r\nThere are two main types of antivirus software that can detect and remove computer viruses and malware: real-time and on-demand. A real-time malware scanner scans for viruses in the background while you’re using your computer. An on-demand scanner, like Microsoft Defender, has to be turned on every time you want to check for malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor full virus and malware protection especially against new and emerging threats. Install real-time malware scanning and removal software.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 2: Run a virus scan<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter installing your antivirus software, you need to check your computer for any malware by running a full virus scan. A comprehensive scanner will search your computer for any malicious code hiding in Windows, and it will get rid of it. Open your antivirus app and select Run Smart Scan.<br><br>\r\nStep 3: Delete or quarantine infected files<br><br>\r\nAfter scanning your PC, your antivirus software will let you know if any malware is found. Follow the steps to remove the virus or put any infected files into quarantine.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 4: Restart your computer<br><br>\r\nAfter deleting the infected files from quarantine, restart your computer. Your laptop’s malware infection will be gone.<br><br>\r\n<b>Android Users</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce you have detected malware on your Android phone, you can remove the malware by following five simple steps.<br><br>\r\nStep 1: Immediately Turn Your Phone Off Before Performing Some Research<br><br>\r\nUpon detecting malware, you should turn the device off entirely while you perform some research. Turning the device off should keep the problem from worsening and may stop the malware from spreading to other networks in the vicinity.\r\nIf you know the name of the application or program that contains malware, you should take this time to research the program’s name to learn more about what it could be doing to your phone. If you don’t know the name, consider looking up the symptoms you’ve noticed on another computer. The only way to eliminate malware on an Android phone is to identify the app that’s infected with malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 2: Turn the Phone On in Safe Mode or Emergency Mode<br><br>\r\nOnce you know which application needs to be uninstalled and deleted, you should turn your phone on in safe mode or emergency mode. Switching to safe mode is relatively simple for most Android devices and can occur by turning your device on, holding the power button down for several seconds, and tapping the power-off button. From here, you should be given “power” options like reboot and safe mode. Once you activate the safe-mode option, your phone will restart. Being in safe mode is necessary to keep the malware from spreading as you uninstall the program with malware in it.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 3: Go to Device Settings to Locate the Malicious App<br><br>\r\nWhen you’re in safe mode, enter the “settings” section on your Android phone. You can access this mode by clicking the gear-shaped icon on the screen. You can also search for the “settings” section on your device. In settings, scroll down until you see the “apps” option, which you should click on. You’ll then be given a list of the applications that are present on your phone. Look through this list until you notice the app that’s infected and needs to be uninstalled. If the application is a core app, you may be unable to delete it. Instead, you would have the option of disabling the app. However, it’s unlikely that a core app is the source of a virus or malware.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 4: Uninstall the Infected Application<br><br>\r\nUninstalling an application is easy and begins with selecting the app, which will provide you with options like “force stop”, “force close”, or “uninstall”. Select the uninstall option to get rid of the application that has been causing problems on your phone. There are times when you will be unable to delete the application that contains the virus properly. This scenario can happen if your phone has been hijacked with ransomware. In this situation, the ransomware can get into your administrative settings, ensuring that the app can’t be deleted. You can fix this problem by going to the main settings menu and selecting the “security” section. From here, search for the “phone device administrators” area. In this area, you should have the ability to change your administrator settings and allow you to delete the app.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 5: Opt For A Factory Reset<br><br>\r\nIf you’re willing to say goodbye to the current media and content on your Android phone, a factory reset is an excellent option to eliminate the malware. This process does remove viruses and malware, but more potent malware may survive. You may detect as much malware as possible with a deep antivirus scan.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStep 6: Download Malware Protection<br><br>\r\nWhen you successfully eliminate the malware, you should focus on downloading malware protection and increasing your knowledge on how to remove malware from Android devices. Ensure that you use a program that will delete unnecessary files, protect your information, and scan for viruses. You should also check for updates regularly to keep the antivirus program up-to-date with the protection it offers.\r\n\r\n', 6),

(13, 'What is pretexting?', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIIvsJ3yi8o', 1, 'Pretexting is a certain type of social engineering technique that manipulates victims into divulging information. A pretext is a made-up scenario developed by threat actors for the purpose of stealing a victim’s personal data.<br><br>\r\nDuring pretexting attacks, threat actors typically ask victims for certain information, stating that it is needed to confirm the victim’s identity. In reality, the threat actor steals this information and then uses it to carry out secondary attacks or identity theft.<br><br>\r\nSophisticated pretexting attacks may attempt to trick victims into performing an action that exploits the physical and/or digital weaknesses of an organization. For example, a threat actor might pretend to be an external IT services auditor and use this alias to convince the physical security team of an organization to allow the threat actor to enter the building.<br><br>\r\nMany threat actors who adopt this attack type masquerade as employees or HR personnel in the finance department. These disguises let them target C-level executives or other employees with extensive privileges, who are more valuable for attackers.<br><br>\r\nWhile phishing attacks tend to use urgency and fear to exploit victims, pretexting attacks establish a false sense of trust with a targeted victim. This requires threat actors to establish a credible story that does not make victims suspicious of any foul play.<br><br>\r\nIn Malaysia, prevalent case of pretexting involves scammers impersonating authorities such as the police, pegawai Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri (LDHN), Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) atau Kastam Diraja Malaysia (KDRM). These scammers contact victims via phone calls or messages and request their personal information.<br><br>\r\nExample of scammer impersonate as LHDN<br><br>\r\n<center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield1/uploads/content/image4.png?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center>\r\n', 7),

The cybercriminal casts themselves as a character and they come up with a plot, or ploy, that convinces victims to trust their character. The pretexting attack is considered successful when the victim falls for the story and takes action because of it. <br><br>\r\nFor instance, a scammer could pose as a person working at a credit card company and call victims asking to confirm their account details. If the victim believes them, they might just hand over their payment information, unbeknownst that it’s indeed heading in the hands of cybercriminals. The following are a few avenues that cybercriminals leverage to create their narrative. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Phishing</b><br><br>\r\nPhishing could be considered pretexting by email. To a degree, the terms go hand in hand because both involve a scenario to convince victims of handing over valuable information. That is by communicating under a false pretext, potentially posing as a trusted source. <br><br>\r\nSo, what is the difference between phishing and pretexting? In addition to the fact that phishing is conducted only by email, it’s also that pretexting relies entirely on emotional manipulation to gain information, while phishing might leverage more technical means like malware to gain information.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Tailgating</b><br><br>\r\nTailgating is like physical phishing. Fraudsters pose in real-life as someone else to gain access to restricted or confidential areas where they can get their hands on valuable information. For example, a tailgating pretexting attack might be carried out by someone impersonating a friendly food deliverer waiting to be let into a building, when in fact it’s a cybercriminal looking to creep on the devices inside.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Smishing</b><br><br>\r\nSmishing is phishing by SMS messaging, or text messaging.

This added effort makes these attacks more difficult to detect. However, there are certain red flags that can help you identify these scams before you become the victim of a larger attack.<br><br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Urgent Language:<br> While a pretexter will go to great lengths to convincingly impersonate a trusted source, they are likely to work to complete the attack as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, the request is likely to include a time frame or language like ASAP, \"immediately\", or \"right away\". The message may also include reasons why a delay is catastrophic.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Unusual Requests:<br> You may receive a text, email, or phone message that follows normal communication routes and conversation styles. Yet, the red flag goes up when the request is out of the ordinary. Any request that requires sensitive information, the transfer of funds, or unusual downloads should be considered suspicious.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>False Familiarity:<br> A pretexting attack may open with casual communications like \"Are you free right now?\", \"I need your help\", or \"Can you do me a favor?\". The correspondence is likely to include your name or the names of people you know to create familiarity. Only after establishing trust, the attacker will reveal the request for money or sensitive information.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Excuses to Avoid Ongoing Communication:<br> A pretexting attack from a supervisor, executive, or CEO might include a reason why you were chosen to carry out a sensitive task as well as the reason they can&#39;t perform it themselves. For example, communications from the CEO might say they&#39;re stuck in meetings all day, making the victim reluctant to make contact for verification.<br><br></li>\r\n  <li>Spoofed Domain:<br> If an attacker doesn&#39;t have access to a legitimate website, they&#39;ll be forced to send communications from an unknown email. To remain discreet, they&#39;re likely to use a similar email or URL domain. In these instances, the sender&#39;s email or a linked URL may include easy-to-miss spelling errors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 8),

The ultimate objective of baiting attacks is to deceive individuals into providing personal information or financial resources that can be exploited by the attackers.<br><br>\r\nEvery human being has some level of curiosity, fear, and greed influencing his decisions and behavior and that is what criminals who set up baiting attacks exploit.

These offers are usually difficult to resist. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Malware-Infected Devices</b><br><br>\r\nAnother way cybercriminals execute a baiting attack is through malware-infected USB devices or flash drives.

Look for official websites, reviews, and independent sources to verify their legitimacy. Be skeptical of unsolicited emails, messages, or phone calls. Learn to think skeptically about any offer that’s too good to be true.</li>\r\n  <li>Be cautious of unrealistic promises: Scammers often entice victims with promises of high pay, easy work, or extravagant rewards. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Exercise caution and use your judgment to identify potential red flags.</li>\r\n  <li>Protect your personal information: Never share sensitive personal information, such as your Social Security number, bank account details, or credit card information, unless you have verified the legitimacy of the recipient and have a legitimate reason to provide it.</li>\r\n  <li>Use secure and reputable platforms: When searching for part-time jobs or engaging in online transactions, use reputable websites or platforms that have established credibility. Look for secure browsing indicators like HTTPS in the website URL.</li>\r\n  <li>Beware of upfront payments or fees: Scammers may ask you to pay upfront fees or provide financial information before starting a job or claiming a reward. Legitimate employers or companies generally do not require payment from employees or winners.</li>\r\n  <li>Trust your instincts: If something feels off or suspicious, trust your gut instinct.

Hence, one must be aware of some viable tactics that are useful for spotting such attacks in action. Here are what works mostly:<br><br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fishy Pop-ups\r\n    <p>Your system is under the threat of a Scareware when you’re seeing too many pop-up messages/content on the screen. Any safe and authorized software installed on the system will not send such frequent pop-ups. Also, a pop-up message delivered via malware is certainly a bit different. For instance, it will keep floating, again and again, the text won’t be very clear, and the colors will be a bit faded. From its looks itself, the pop-up message doesn’t seem genuine. One can easily make out that it’s fake.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fear-inciting Messages\r\n    <p>If you get constant fear-infesting notifications or messages like your system is under attack, download the anti-virus now to protect your device, your data is leaked, and so on, understand that a hacker is planning a Scareware attack on you. The scarier would be the notification, higher are the possibilities of succeeding in the attack. Legitimate software doesn’t advertise like that.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Blocked Access to Old files\r\n    <p>When you’re facing trouble accessing your previously saved system files to the browser, then it’s mostly because of malware that is blocking the pathway.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Fake System Update Suggestions\r\n    <p>Stay alert after constant update requests from software as it&#39;s traps to lure you into a Scareware attack. If you want to check available software update details, go to Setting > App > Updates.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Degradation in Performance\r\n    <p>The presence of malware on a system will cause certain obvious operational faults like slow computer performance, excessive battery drainage, frequent unresponsiveness, screen blur, and so on. It’s because of the excessive burden that the device is facing because of the presence of malware.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br><center><img class=\"img-content\" src=\"/socialshield1/uploads/content/image219.png?txt=128381@_7djajhufa8__\"></center>\r\n', 15),

Users can also remove scareware malware manually.<br><br>\r\nThe process to manually remove scareware is normally straightforward. It involves identifying and uninstalling the malicious download. Scareware typically hides in plain sight as a legitimate antivirus program.<br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Turn off your computers immediately. As long as you&#39;re using your computer, your data and details are under attack.</li>\r\n  <li>If you need to use your system anyhow, try to use it without any internet connection. It’s the internet connectivity that is keeping the malware and the hacker linked. So, destroy that link to minimize the damage.</li>\r\n  <li>Take your infected system to an IT expert. As a novice, you won’t be able to find the severity of the attack. Hence, it’s better to take professional help.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 15),

Tools such as an antivirus product can scan devices and detect and remove malware such as scareware.</li>\r\n  <li>Use common sense. Do not click on in-browser pop-ups about security. Do not provide personal or financial information to untrusted or unknown websites.</li>\r\n  <li>Use pop-up blockers, firewalls, and URL filters. These will help prevent pop-ups from showing up and stop attacks.</li>\r\n  <li>Keep browsers updated. This keeps the browser secure, potentially helping to eliminate any weaknesses to scareware pop-ups.</li>\r\n  <li>Close the browser rather than just the pop-up notification. Some scareware techniques scam users by having a fake Close or X button that installs malware when selected. This is known as clickjacking.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 15);
